# Programming Tasks

## 28 February

Write a program that takes an array of real numbers of size 7 and calculates the sum and mean of all the elements. Also, depict the memory management of this task.

Add a method in the same class that splits the existing array into two. The method should search for a key in the array and, if found, split the array from the index of the key.

## 2 March

Write a Java program to perform autoboxing and also implement different methods of the wrapper class.

Write a Java program that takes 3 strings and demonstrates that strings are immutable.

## 6 March, 17 April

Declare an array of size `n` to store account balances. Initialize with values 0 to 100000 and sort account numbers according to the highest balance values using quick sort. For example:
Account No. 3547 Balance 28000
Account No. 1245 Balance 12000

Write a program that takes an unordered list of integers (or any other objects, e.g., strings) and rearranges the list in natural order using merge sort.

## 24 April

Write a program initializing an array of size 20 and searching for an element using binary search.

Write a function called `occurrences` that, given an array of numbers `A`, prints all the distinct values in `A`, each followed by its number of occurrences. For example, if `A = (28, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 3)`, the function should output: 
28 1
1 2
0 4
3 2 
4 1

## 8 May

Enter data for a cricket team of 11 players, where each player's runs are stored as a hash table value. Find out the rank number of a player based on the formula: `Runs % 11`. For example, if runs are 30, the index number is 8, and rank #8 is the rank of the team member. (Use HashTable ADT class)

Harold, a kidnapper, is worried his ransom note might be traced back to him through his handwriting. He wants to know if he can cut out whole words from a magazine to replicate his ransom note exactly. The words in his note are case-sensitive, and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. He cannot use substrings or concatenation.
Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print "Yes" if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print "No". For example: magazine = "attack at dawn" note = "Attack at dawn"
The magazine has all the right words, but there is a case mismatch, so the answer is "No".

## 26 June

Write a program that converts infix expressions to postfix expressions using a stack implemented with a linked list. Example expression: `A + (B * C - (D / E | F) * G) * H`

Write a program that evaluates the following postfix expression using a stack implemented with an array.

Write a program that processes a group of input lines, each containing an 'A' for arrival, a 'D' for departure, and a license plate number. Cars are assumed to arrive and depart in the order specified. The program should:
a) Print a message whenever a car arrives or departs.
b) When a car arrives, the message should specify whether there is room for the car in the garage. If there is no room, the car leaves without entering the garage.
c) When a car departs, the message should include the number of times the car was moved out of the garage to allow other cars to depart.

Write a program to implement a stack using a queue.
